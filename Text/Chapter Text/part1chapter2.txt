Sir MacCumail is a character, but his insight is like no one's I've heard.
It is a shame I cannot take him with me.

These extra few days should help with preparing for winter, Lady Sadhbh.

It's a slow ride, isn't it?
I would usually go faster than this.

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadFerdiad][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]
None of us have ridden outside of Caer Rigor before, Lady Sadhbh.
The ground here is softer and wet.
Please excuse our inexperience.

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadCethern][MoveRight][OpenRight]
What's happened since Heichalot declared war?
I assume not much yet.

[OpenMidLeft]
We've heard of attacks organized from Caer Vedwyd, but nothing more.
Trying to gather information is tricky, early as it is now.
But it's salt in the wounds, planning invasion from our land.

[OpenFarRight]
Caer Vedwyd...
That's where your grandfather fought, yes?

[OpenRight]
That's right.[ToggleSmile]
If he knew all this, maybe he would've came along.

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadSetanta]
He'd probably try to even his own score despite his age.
I don't think he'd care if he died trying that.

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It's definitely a plan of some Caer Siddi nobles to plan a retaking of Caer Vedwyd.
But for now, we're on the defensive.

[OpenFarRight]
We're startled with war, and all the nobles can think about are land grabs.[CloseEyes]
I can't stand nobility at all.[OpenEyes]

[OpenRight]
S[0xE9]tanta, you know Lady Sadhbh is part of the nobility, right?
Same with all of the Crownfliers.

[OpenMidLeft]
No, no. It's all okay.
I have a distaste for nobles as well.
It's not like they enjoy my company much either.

[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
You're quite a knight then, Sadhbh.
I think I actually like you.

So I snuck out of town with Airmed, but she got caught.[MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]
