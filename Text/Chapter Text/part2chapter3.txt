I apologize, but I see no way around it...
We must fight.[X]

For the unity of both Anila and Antariksa...
I must halt your passage![X]

You're that false prophet of Hwen...
The one responsible for our Shuka's death![ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
What do you want with me?
Am I truly so important...?[ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadBabhru]
Your order holds you on an altar of lies.
Hwen and Bhatn would seek your death![ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
How could you say that?
That's not true...![ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadBabhru]
And who tells you that truth?
Your hag of a greatmother?
Those delusions in your head?
I'll silence your lies, I promise you that![X]

You...![MoveMidLeft]
You're that white-haired oracle.[.....]
So you really are here!
Yet, you don't even have a weapon...[MoveMidLeft]
Why would you come towards me?
I'm the enemy...[.....]
You know that, right?

[MidRight]
You're hesitant, aren't you...?
I can feel your feet sulk on the ground.

[MidLeft]
You can feel it in my footsteps?
No magic tome can do that...
You're lying, aren't you?
Trying to fool me into your cause?

[MidRight]
The Earthmother brings me many blessings...
Your movements tell me that you're reluctant to fight against us.
You don't have to believe in my powers.
But will you believe me when I say I don't wish to fight you either?

[MidLeft]
I...[MoveMidLeft]
What is it, then?
Do you wish to capture me?
Hold me ransom against my greatmother?

[MidRight]
Join us, please.[.....]
Our group is worried over the balance of Bhuloka...
Fight with us, and we can find a better solution than war.

[MidLeft]
That sounds silly.[.....]
I'm not sure if there's a way to stop this fighting.
But, as much as I believe that there's no solution...[.....]
I want to find one.
What is your name, oracle?

[MidRight]
My name is Srihwen.[MoveMidRight]
Quickly, before the Anilan Order notices us...![X]
