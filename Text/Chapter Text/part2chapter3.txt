So we must fight...
This is unfortunate.[X]

For the unity of both Anila and Antariksa...
I must halt your passage![X]

You're that false prophet Dhara keeps locked away...
The one responsible for our Shuka's death![ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
What do you want with me?
Am I truly so important...?[ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadBabhru]
Your order holds you on an altar of lies.
Hwen and Bhatn would seek your death![ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
I follow the Earthmother's heart...
You can't--![ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadBabhru]
You could never comprehend the divinity of Anila...
So who tells you the lies of Hwen's heart?
Your hag of a greatmother?
Those delusions in your head?
I'll silence your lies, I can promise you that![X]

You...![MoveMidLeft]
You're that white-haired oracle![.....]
So you really are here...
Yet, you don't even have a weapon...[MoveMidLeft]
Why would you come towards me?
I'm your enemy.[.....]
You know that, right?

[MidRight]
You're hesitant, aren't you...?
I can feel your feet sulk on the ground.

[MidLeft]
You can feel it in my footsteps?
No magic tome can do that...
You're lying, aren't you?
Trying to fool me into your cause?

[MidRight]
The Earthmother brings me many blessings...
Your movements tell me that you're reluctant to fight against us.
You don't have to believe in my powers.
But will you believe me when I say I don't wish to fight you either?

[MidLeft]
I...[MoveMidLeft]
What is it, then?
Do you wish to capture me?
Hold me ransom against my greatmother?

[MidRight]
Join us, please.[.....]
Our group is worried over the balance of Bhuloka...
Fight with us, and we can find a better solution than war.

[MidLeft]
That sounds silly.[.....]
I'm not sure if there's a way to stop this fighting.
But, as much as I believe that there's no solution...[.....]
I want to find one.
What is your name, oracle?

[MidRight]
My name is Srihwen.[MoveMidRight]
Quickly, before the Anilan Order notices us...![X]

[MidRight][LoadNakstrani]
So they're here already...
It looks like this truly will be a war.
Is this really worth it, greatmother?

[MidLeft][LoadEnemySoldier]
Hey, lassie!
Just because you're Antariksan don't give you a free pass!
You still gotta fight with the rest of us!

[MidRight][MidLeft][ClearFace][......][MidRight]
Hmm...
I can cover this road.
Nobody'll come up from there, so I should be a little safer.
I wonder if that pale harpy they're so obsessed with is here?
Not like that would change much, though...
It seems I'm doomed no matter what.[X]
