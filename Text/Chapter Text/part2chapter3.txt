You're that false prophet of Hwen...
The one responsible for our Shuka's death![ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
What do you want with me?
Am I truly so important...?[ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadBabhru]
Your order holds you on an altar of lies.
Hwen and Bhatn would seek your death![ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
That's not true...!
How could you say--[ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadBabhru]
And who told you that?
Your hag of a greatmother?
Those delusions in your head?
I'll silence your lies, I promise you that![X]
