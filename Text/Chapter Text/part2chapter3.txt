If I truly must,[.5] I will.[A][X]

You're that false prophet[N]
Dhara keeps locked away...[AN]
The one responsible for[N]
our Shuka's death![A][ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
What do you want with me?[.6][N]
Am I truly so important...?[A][ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadBabhru]
Your order holds you on[N]
an altar of lies.[AN]
Hwen and Bhatn would seek[N]
your death![A][ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
I follow the Springmother's[N]
desires...[.6] You can't--![A][ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadBabhru]
You could never comprehend[N]
the divinity of Anila...[AN]
So who tells you these[N]

Your hag of a greatmother?[.5][N]
Those delusions of yours?[AN]
I'll silence your lies,[.5] I can[N]

[MidLeft][LoadNakstrani]
You...![......][MoveMidLeft] You're that white-haired oracle![......][N]
So you really are here...[AN]
Yet,[.....] you don't even have a weapon...[......][N]
Why would you come towards me?[AN]
I'm your enemy.[......] You know that, right?[A]

[MidRight]
You're hesitant,[......] aren't you...?[......][N]
I can feel your feet sulk on the ground.[A]

[MidLeft]
You can feel it in my footsteps?[......][N]
No magic tome can do that...[AN]
You're lying,[.5] aren't you?[.6] Trying[N]
to fool me into your cause?[A]

[MidRight]
The Springmother has given me[N]
many of her blessings...[AN]
Your movements tell me you're[N]
reluctant to fight against us.[AN]
Will you believe me if I say I[N]
don't wish to fight you either?[A]

[MidLeft]
Do you wish to proselytize me[N]
to your Springmother?[AN]
Is that your goal?[.6] You're not much[N]
different than Antariksa.[A]

[MidRight]
No...![.6] I want you to join us![AN]
Our grove is worried over the[N]
balance of Bhuloka...[AN]
We're not looking to conquer.[.5][N]
All we want is peace.[A]

[MidLeft]
You seek peace,[.5] yet you find[N]
it by fighting the orders...[AN]
No matter who wins,[.5] this will[N]
paint Bhuloka with blood.[AN]
But,[.4] as much as I believe[N]
there's no solution...[AN]
I want to find one.[.6] I want to[N]
fight alongside you.[AN]

[MidRight]
Then we should move before the[N]
Anilan Order notices us...![A][X]



## P2C3NakstraniDoubt
[MidRight][LoadNakstrani]
So they're here already...[AN]
It looks like this truly[N]
will be a war.[AN]
Is this really worth it,[.4][N]
greatmother?[A]

[MidLeft][LoadEnemySoldier]
Hey,[.5] lassie![.6] Back to earth![AN]
Just because you're Antariksan[N]
don't give you a free pass.[AN]
You still gotta fight with the[N]
rest of us![A]

[MidRight][MidLeft][ClearFace][......][MidRight]
Hmm...[.6] I can hide in the woods.[AN]
Nobody'll come up from there,[.5] so[N]
I should be a little safer.[AN]
I wonder if that pale harpy they're[N]
so obsessed with is here?[AN]
Not like that would change much...[.5][N]
It seems Bhuloka is damned.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadBlackHairGirl]
When it comes to sporting,[.....] I've always[N]
preferred a discus to a javelin.[AN]
I find them easier to throw,[.....] but if[N]
I somehow got involved in a fight...[AN]
A javelin would probably be a better[N]
weapon to protect myself than a disc.[AN]
But,[.....] I don't see myself going to war[N]
for any reason any time soon.[AN]
You got any use for a javelin like[N]
this?[......] If so,[.....] it's yours.[A][X]

I'm just a healer![AN]

Just please,[.4] let me live![A][X]

Excuse me,[.5] who are you?[A]

[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKhema]
I believe I can explain who he is.[.6][N]
That's Birnath,[.5] a knight of Pancala.[AN]
While you were gone,[.5] I explained our[N]
situation to the houses of Srughna.[AN]
Though I couldn't get any aid,[.5] he and[N]

We are gathered here to exchange[N]
information,[.5] Birnath.[AN]
We shall determine our best course[N]
of action once we talk.[AN]

[FarLeft]
I found out after the assault that[N]
Prabhasa's currently ambivalent.[AN]
There's been some internal strife[N]
about who to side with.[A][X]



## P2C3EthniuInterject

Prabhasa?[.6] Did Bres finally take[N]
over as the greatfather?[A]

It was someone named Bholenath who[N]
told them of the situation.[AN]
He wanted to assist us, but some[N]
of their monks wish to defect.[A]



## P2C3KhemaPrabhasa
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKhema]
Assuming Prabhasa comes to our aid,[.6][N]
we still face a numbers problem.[AN][.6]
