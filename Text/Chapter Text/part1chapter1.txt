You stay there, Gontia.
I'm only here to practice for a bit.
Alright, what was the procedure?
Focus... Allow the wind to show you its method, its own behaviour.[AN]
... Aim your bow.
One eye on the target, and one on the wind.[......]
And then there was another step,[MoveLeft][CloseEyes] but I can't remember it! Ugh!

[OpenFarFarRight]
Hey Fern! Your pa was looking for you! What are you doing out here?

[OpenLeft][OpenEyes][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
S[0xE9]tanta! Were you watching me?!
And please don't call me that...
[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadSetanta][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh come on, it's only fourteen years of it.
You can't be sick of the name yet!

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
I am sick of it, shockingly.[OpenEyes]
Now could you please go away?
I'm trying to practice my archery.

[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Archery, huh?
You're really sticking with it.
So who are you trying to impress, your parents or Cethern?

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Leave![......]
Though... if you've gotta ask,[CloseEyes] it's Cethern.[OpenEyes]
You and him have been showing off sparring in town, and I've got nothing to show for it but my horse riding.
I've gotta pick up a weapon soon, and this one's coming the easiest.

[OpenFarFarRight]
So you were trying to impress me?
I'd say you were doing a good job.

[OpenMidLeft]
Cethern, are you there too?!

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadCethern][MoveRight][OpenRight]
We were gonna deliver the news sooner, but I wanted to see how you were doing.[ToggleSmile]
Not bad for just having picked it up.

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
Why do you both have to torture me like this...[OpenEyes]

[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Hey, it's a compliment from Cethern.
Isn't that a good thing?

[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
S[0xE9]tanta, you don't have to tease her that much.
Past that, we should probably head back to town soon.
Don't wanna keep your father waiting too long for us.

[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Spoken like a true knight.

[OpenRight][CloseEyes]
So I'm not safe from your jabs, either...[A][X]

To think a town like this would be such easy pickings...
I guess the crown really is busy with everything else!
Give us all you got or we'll burn this place down![A]

[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
How did we leave ourselves so open to this...?[OpenEyes]
We'll give what we have.
Just don't hurt any of us.

[OpenMidRight]
Of course you will!
Start collecting it now![ClearFace][......]

[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x61][0x1][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]
I tried finding Cethern and S[0xE9]tanta, but their horses are gone!

There has to be someone who can help![X]

Oh no!
Those are brigands!

[OpenRight]
They must have saw us leave town and barged in.
Dammit![MoveRight][CloseEyes] We should've seen this coming![OpenEyes]

[OpenMidLeft]
Calm down.
If they're only brigands, they're probably untrained.
We can most likely take them out with the three of us.

[OpenRight]
The three of us?!
Do you not notice we're completely outnumbered?!

[OpenFarRight]
Cethern's right.
Our families are in danger the longer we stay watching them.

[OpenRight]
You barely know how to use that bow, Fern!
You could die!

[OpenMidLeft][......]
S[0xE9]tanta, stay close by me.
Ferdiad, stay in the back.[MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
None of us are going to die.
I won't allow it. Now come on, let's get moving![X]

Brigands?
Why am I not surprised?
We're so far away from the capital that it'd be shocking to get any actual protection or care from them.
But at the same time, we don't usually need it...[X]

This isn't like you S[0xE9]tanta.
You're fighting with us?

[OpenMidRight]
It's Fern.[N]
If she got hurt, I don't know what I'd do.
As long as she's out here, I gotta stay.

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
That's quite noble.
Or maybe it's something else...?

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Cethern, if you finish that thought, I will join the brigands.[X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFerdiad][OpenMidLeft][LoadCethern]
Ferdiad.
Are you holding up well?

[OpenMidRight]
I'll be fine.
I'm more scared for you two.
You said they're untrained, but they still seem dangerous!

[OpenMidLeft]
S[0xE9]tanta and I have traded blows more times than I can count.
You're the one we should be worried about. Make sure to stay behind us.

[OpenMidRight]
I know that,[CloseEyes] but this isn't training.[OpenEyes]
If we're all gonna fighting like this, please be careful.
I can't protect you as much as I'd like with a bow and arrow.

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'll keep that in mind, Ferdiad.
You stay careful as well.[X]

I'm staying with you both.
I don't care how dangerous it is.

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Come on, Fern![ToggleSmile] 
It'd suck if you had to die the same way Cethern and I will.

[OpenMidRight]
You're not going to.
I'm not letting my mother down by letting either of you get killed.

[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm,[ToggleSmile] so you were trying to impress your parents after all!
[MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight][ClearFace]

Thank the bearers!
You two are truly our saviours!
I'm glad to know that your training came in hand.

[OpenRight]
It's nothing.
Ferdiad's coming behind us.
She was a big help as well.

[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Where's everyone else?
Any wounded?

[OpenMidLeft]
There's a few injured.
Cethern, your grandfather got a few of them on his own.
Miach and Airmed are checking after him with the nurse.
They're thankfully both safe.

[OpenRight]
They're helping with that?
There's something interesting.

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadFerdiad]
I'm sorry![CloseEyes] I'm very sorry for riding out with no warning...[OpenEyes]
Is my father okay too?

[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, yes![AN]
Thankfully uninjured as well.
You'll have to find him though.
He's always out and about, huh?

[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]
I'll see you and S[0xE9]tanta later.
I'm not entirely sure what he wants...[ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadSetanta][.....]

[OpenMidLeft]
I should take my leave as well.
There's plenty of cleanup to be done.
Don't worry, I won't force either of you to.
You're heroes enough![ClearFace][.....]

[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadCethern]
I'm gonna head out and check on my father.
We should meet up with Ferdiad later and talk to her about everything.
T[CloseEyes]oday was quite a day...[OpenEyes]

[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
I don't have much else to do myself.
Guess I'll check on my pa too.[MoveMidRight]
Meet up together at the usual spot?

[OpenMidLeft]
I'll make sure of it.[ToggleSmile]
We make a great duo, don't we?

[OpenMidRight]

You try holding it! It's hotter and heavier than you think!

[OpenMidRight]
I can't believe the nurse let you do this with me!

[OpenMidLeft]
I can't believe the nurse thought you were the best person to take care of him! 
If you're gonna nag at me, do the whole thing yourself!

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadCethern]
Miach? Airmed?
Are you both in there?

It's Cethern![MoveMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]

I see you're both quite busy.

I guess you could say that.
You both taking care of our old man?

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'm trying to take care of him.
But Miach keeps messing everything up!

[OpenFarLeft]
Sorry, who did the nurse say could help?
You're not even helping, only bothering me around![MoveFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Can I come kill some brigands instead with you next time, Cethern?

[OpenFarRight]
I'll think about it. 
I think you've got a lot of training yourself before you could help.

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
That's not fair! 
Am I not allowed?
I've actually been working myself tired unlike some brothers!
I'm barely even younger than you!

[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]
...[ToggleSmile]Maybe I should leave you two alone.
You're better taking care of him without me distracting you.
I'll be out helping with some of the clean-up.

[ClearFace][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft][......]

You scared him away!

What are you talking about?!
It was obviously your begging![X]

Took you a while, Fern.
What was the big deal?

[OpenRight]
My father can be quite persistent in worrying about me.
Just some rumours that have him riled up about me running off.

[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
After your ma I assume...[OpenEyes]
Where is she anyways?

[OpenRight]
I think she's up in Caer Wydyr right now.
There's been some tensions with Heichalot, but she couldn't tell me much else.

[OpenFarRight]
Caer Wydyr? That's up to the north, isn't it?

[OpenMidLeft]
That's a fair bit away.
Though, A[0xED]fe makes trips all over the place...[MoveMidLeft]
Hopefully we're overthinking.

[OpenRight][CloseEyes]
I hope we are.[......][MoveRight][OpenEyes] 
How were Miach and Airmed? Bickering like always?

[OpenMidLeft]
That's what they do.
I guess I'm lucky I never had that phase with them.
Sometimes I feel more like their father than an older brother...

[OpenFarRight]
Though, your grandpa is quite someone.[ToggleSmile]
I'm sure the brigands were scared for their life when they saw that old man chasing them down with a sword!

[OpenMidLeft]
That's true,[ToggleSmile] but I wish he was more active without being provoked like this...

[OpenRight]
Hold on! Do you both hear that?[MoveRight]
There's something coming in the air.

Is that a pegasus knight?

It's not my mother,
but still a sky knight...[OpenEyes]

[OpenLeft]
This is Cluain Bolg.
May I ask who you are?

[OpenMidRight]
I am Sadhbh of the Crownflight.
I've been tasked with finding two figures who may help with...
recent political developments.

[OpenFarLeft]
The Crownflight?![MoveFarLeft]
...So you're looking for my mother?

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
You must be A[0xED]fe's daughter.
I assume much has changed since we last met.
Where may I find her?

[OpenFarLeft]
She left for Caer Wydyr yesterday...
I'm very sorry, Lady Sadhbh.

[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
That is unfortunate on my part.[OpenEyes]
What about a Sir MacCumail?
I've heard quite a few tales of him.

[OpenLeft]
That would be my grandfather. 
I can show you to him, but he's completely exhausted.
A few hours ago we fought off some brigands.[MoveLeft] 
What did you need him for...?

[OpenMidRight]
I suppose I may as well tell.
Though it only happened a short bit ago.[......][MoveMidRight][......][LoadOverworldFaces]
The Principality of Heichalot has declared war on the entirety of Corbenic.
I was hoping to gather support from two warriors I had heard were the best, but it appears that my flight was indeed for naught.

[OpenFarLeft]
W[.....]-War?![.....][MoveFarLeft]
That can't be!

[OpenMidRight]
It seems that a few bandits have already begun to take advantage of the chaos.
Your village should stay very alert.

[OpenLeft]
...If you want to talk to my father, you could stay the night and speak in the morning.
Of course, I don't think he's fought since the rebellion all the way in Caer Vedwyd...

[OpenMidRight]
Caer Vedwyd?[MoveMidRight][CloseEyes]
But that was more than fourty years ago![......][OpenEyes]
I have no reason to see your grandfather.
Please send him my regards. I must go.

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadSetanta]
Wait, you're leaving that quickly?[ToggleSmile]
Sadhbh, you're stifling your opportunity.

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
S[0xE9]tanta!
You need to be--

[OpenMidRight]
It is fine. But opportunity...
What do you mean?

[OpenFarLeft]
You're in a village that you know has two amazing warriors.[ToggleSmile]
Don't you wanna see what you can gather?
Any possible advice or information?
Maybe try to recruit some people?

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
That is a fair point.
Talking with Sir MacCumail may be beneficial in some way.
Would there be any place for me to prepare for the night if so?

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'm sure I could bother my pa.
But keep the pegasus safe.[ToggleSmile]
Don't know if the bandits might return any time soon.

[OpenMidRight]
That would be most excellent.
Thank you, S[0xE9]tanta.
[ClearFace][.......]

[OpenRight][LoadFerdiad][LoadOverworldFaces]
Offering that to her?
That's very nice, S[0xE9]tanta.
What's changed?

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
My pa's lonely!
He could use a companion for the night.

[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh,[CloseEyes] of course it's that!
Why did I assume otherwise?![OpenEyes]

[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
It's getting late. 
Should we head back in?
We can always talk again tomorrow.

[OpenRight]
...Yes. I'm feeling quite exhausted.
Though, I'd like to talk a bit to that Crownflier tomorrow.

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'll come wake you before she leaves.[......][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile] 
I'm more concerned about what she told us...[OpenEyes]

## MaghmeallIntro
Maghmeall,[.....] year 879.[.....] A continent[N]
covered in past bloodshed.[AN]
The tides of war have calmed,[....][N]
and relative peace has been[AN]
enjoyed in Maghmeall for the[N]
previous fourty years.[AN]
The five nations that inhabit[N]
Maghmeall draw their origin[AN]
from legendary beings known[N]
as the Wardbearers.[AN]
Before the nations stood,[.....] the[N]
Wardbearers extinguished the[AN]
corruption that had taken root[N]
in Maghmeall,[.....] allowing[AN]
their subjects to live in peace.[AN]
Those humans grew to create[N]
the five nations of Maghmeall,[AN]
continuing to venerate those who[N]
gifted them purity and life.[A][X]

## MaghmeallTwo
The north holds twin nations:[N]
Myanchao and Heichalot.[A][N]
The Principality of Heichalot is[N]
ruled by the Heavenly Prince,[AN]
and its people survive the arid[N]
seasons with piety and labour.[AN]
Meanwhile further east,[....][N]
the united Myanchao peoples live[AN]
diverse lives among the ranging[N]
climate of their land,[....] under[AN]
the rule of their matriarch.[AN]
To the opposite end lies the[N]
Kingdom of Srughna,[.....] isolated[AN]
from its northern neighbours[N]
by edict of its new king.[AN]
Its east is covered by the[N]
forest of Bhuloka,[....] a dense[AN]
yet truly isolated collection[N]
of monasteries and villages.[A][X]

## MaghmeallThree
Finally,[.....] in the centre of Maghmeall,[.....][N]
the Kingdom of Corbenic acts as[AN]
crossroads for the many nations,[.....][N]
and many of its people live[AN]
comfortably because of it.[AN]
These nations have existed ever[N]
since the disappearance[AN]
of the Wardbearers almost a[N]
millenia ago.[AN]
However,[.....] tensions among several[N]
nations are viciously stirring[AN]
