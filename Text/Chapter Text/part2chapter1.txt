[MoveMidRight]Oh? You're busy?

I'm scared to head back out...
There were a bunch of scary-lookin' guys outside of town.
My uncle said if I was in danger, to use this book...
But then my ma said never to use it!
I tried readin' it, but none of it made any sense...

A silver-haired girl that reminded me of you...

Would that happen to be you?

My daughter always wanted to be a Srughnan knight...
So I tried my hardest to help her train.
Gave her a spear, to give her a head start, ya know?
Well, turns out she wanted to ride a wyvern!
And they train wyvern riders with axes!
That head start was for nothin'!
She's headed out, but she left one of her spears here.

We're not supposed to be here.
What would the greatmother say if she saw us?

You two would be fine.
It's me who would be on the line.

You're basically the greatmother's daughters, you two.
If only she'd babysit you more.

Next time, don't leave me with Soma.
But now that I'm here, it's time for you two to leave.

Apparently Dhara needed some help with something.
And I was the one who got sent.

It's great to have help then...

For as long as I can remember, Anila and Dhara have hated each other.
I'm not exactly sure what it is...
I do know something though.
The Dharan monastery only allows women, and the Anilan one only allows men.
It's probably something relating to that.
But I'm not a monk.

The people back there called me different titles.
That white-haired priestess, the Dharan caged bird...
Have I missed something while in the monastery?

You've only gotten out when you're with us, right?
It'd make sense if you didn't hear most of the rumours.

[MidLeft]
Rumours...?
Am I that infamous?

[FarRight]
I'm afraid you are.
It's why Khema locks you and Soma up.
A woman with the Wardbearers' power is quite something.

The greatmother locks us up for that?

I'm a perfectly fine guard for you!

That, and I can only commune with Hwen...

It is unsafe outside for Srihwen.

[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadEthniu]
Greatmother Khema, please tell us what's going on.
Why did you meet with Antariksa?

[MidLeft]
I suppose you three should be informed eventually...
The Antariksan Order wishes to form an alliance.
A political alliance between the eight Orders of Bhuloka.

[FarRight]
What's the point of that?
Do we need to be united like Macha?

[MidLeft]
It relates to Srughna and Heichalot.
There is fear between action from either of them.
Antariksa wants us to be able to stand up as a force of our own.

[Right]
Wouldn't that mean aligning with Anila...?
Why would they attack us then?

[MidLeft]
Both our Order and the Order of Chandra have opposed this idea.
Meeting with Antariksa, our grove only fueled that sentiment.
It seems the Anilan Order wanted to be proactive in action.

[FarRight]
So because we didn't wish to join, they're trying to subjugate us...
Miserable. Why would we align with Anila after all they've done?[ClearFace]

[LoadSoma]
How's the Chandran Order doing?
Have they been attacked as well?

I have heard nothing from them.
But either way, your actions were foolish.
