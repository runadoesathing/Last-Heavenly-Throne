Srihwen, Greatmother Khema and the group meet either at the bungalow or inside the monastery (if Varuna and Nandi are dead).
If at the bungalow, Birnath will come out with the Dasarna gang, and Sirin will be introduced by Khema later (Birnath was heavy on my pegasi to carry over!). If at the monastery, Sirin will come out with Khema.
They discuss what happened at the Anusuya monastery, and their plans going forward.
Khema states that while everyone was gone, she beeseched Avanti and Pancala for help
While both refused, with the new information two of Pancala's soldiers defected to Dhara's cause: Sirin and Birnath.
As they discuss, Soma brings up that her grove told her Prabhasa's greatfather, Bholenath, has yet to make up his mind.
She mentions that perhaps other orders would also be on the fence of joining.
Khema states that the most likely order to join against Antariksa would be the descendants of Bhatn, the Pavakan people.
She mentions the biggest obstacle would be finding them. Srihwen mentions her power. Khema is wary as the Pavakan people are allegedly past Anilan territory.
The others pledge to keep Srihwen safe, and Khema agrees to finally completely allow Srihwen to fight against the Antariksan people. She charges Srihwen to sneak through Anila's territory and attempt to align with the Pavakan people.

In Anila, Kalkin discusses with the Mangala grove of Anila that Dhara is beginning to mobilize. He tells them that the Sagarian Order has agreed to align themselves with Antariksa's goals, and that his next plan is to subjugate the defiant Pratyushan and Pavakan Orders into submission. Since Dhara would want an order with a similar belief system to them on their side, he tells the grove to fortify their borders as soon as possible. The representative of the Mangala grove orders Babhru, a devout lower-ranking monk, to guard the eastern border into the "Pavakan lands". Babhru is angry that he's being assigned what he considers to be a useless position, but agrees.

Soma explains the concept of groves to Srihwen, while Sirin scouts ahead (to Varuna's chagrin). Dhara has no groves because its "groves" were taken over by the Anilans during the religious schism. Sirin alerts the group to the fortified presence of Anila on the border into the Pavakan territory. The group shows up on map, Babhru notices them, let's go prep screen.
