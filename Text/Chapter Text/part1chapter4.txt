Ochren is a calm and quiet[N]

unbothered by affairs of either[N]
Corbenic's crown or Heichalot.[AN]

So, how much are you[N]
gettin' for this?[A]

[MidLeft]
To be perfectly frank,[.5][N]
not that much.[AN]
Not the best job,[.5] but it's[N]
what pays the most.[A]

[MidRight]
Why don't you join us?[AN]
It's not really a job,[.5][N]
but come on.[AN]
You don't wanna have to[N]
fight me or Ethniu.[A]

[MidLeft]
Ethniu,[.5] right...[.6][ToggleSmile] You know what,[.5] Aengus?[.6][N]
I might take you up on that.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadGedeon]
Ethniu?[.6] Why are you all[N]
the way out here?![A]

[MidRight]
Is it really that[N] 
much of a surprise?[AN]
I'm not chained to[N]
my brother,[.5] Gedeon.[A]

[MidLeft]
I know that,[.5] but I thought you[N]
were helping him back in town![A]

[MidRight]
Found a better job.[.5][N]
Looks like you have too.[A]

[MidLeft]
I wouldn't call it a better job.[AN]
My last one fell through,[.5] and[N]
it's hard enough.[AN]
This is the only thing I could[N]
find that pays.[A]

[MidRight]
It doesn't pay,[.5] but you could[N]
always fight with us.[AN]
I think my brother would[N]
loathe one of us dying.[A]

[MidLeft]
Aengus?[.6] Loathing something?[N]
I couldn't imagine him being[N]
that serious.[AN]
But at the same time,[.5] I don't[N]
think I'd wanna risk it...[A]

[MidRight]
So you're coming with us?[A]

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You know what,[.5] Ethniu?[.6][N]
I think I will.[A][X]



## P1C4DiabolistHouse

[MidRight][LoadBlondeMan]
You've got to watch your[N]
belongings near magicians.[AN]
Once I was in Caer Siddi,[.4][N]
walking down the street...[AN]
Next thing I know,[.5] this[N]
girl in a cape runs by me![AN]
I didn't even notice it,[.5] but[N]
she'd stolen all my coin![AN]
And good luck trying to get[N]
it back from them![AN]
I still have the burns on[N]
my chest from trying![A][X]



## P1C4RionallHouse
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF]
[MidRight][LoadBrunetteMan]
I never would've imagined Lord[N]
Rionall to side with Heichalot.[AN]
He's always been the saviour of[N]
Ochren.[.6] Our saviour.[AN]
When Caer Siddi ignored our pleas[N]
for help,[.5] he would answer us.[AN]
Unlike the capital,[.5] he truly treats[N]
us as his own.[AN]
It hurts to see this unfold...[A][X]



## P1C4LightMagicHouse
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF]
[MidRight][LoadOldMan]
Light magic,[.5] holy magic,[.5] or[N]
whatever you call it...[AN]
It is the absolute power of[N]
the Wardbearers.[AN]
To come into contact with their[N]
essence weakens the body.[AN]
The scars it leaves behind hurt[N]
the soul as much as the flesh.[AN]
So, if you ever make a diviner[N]
of the Wardbearers angry...[AN]
Dodge their strikes.[.6] You'd hate[N]
to live with the wounds.[A][X]

These forests sure are dense...[.6] Even[N]
more than the ones back home.[A]

[MidLeft]
It's rockier too.[.6] Watch[N]
where you're going.[AN]

[Right]
So...[.6] Have either of you[N]
ever been to Heichalot?[A]

[MidLeft]
I've gone to Caer Siddi a few[N]
times with my grandfather...[AN]
But never Heichalot.[.6] Not even[N]
up to Uffren.[A]

[FarRight]
I've actually been there a few[N]
times.[.6] I was pretty young, though.[AN]
Hard to recall anything about it.[A]

[Right]
Oh, right![.6] Fern, you're not[N]
from Cluain Bolg,[.4] are you?[A]

[FarRight]
For as long as I can remember,[.5][N]
I've been in Cluain Bolg.[AN]
But in all honesty,[.5] I'm not[N]
actually sure where I'm from.[A]

[MidLeft]
You're not sure?[.6] You've told us--[A]

[FarRight]
I know what I've told you two.[.6] That[N]
was just to get you off my back.[AN]
Every time I've brought the topic[N]
up to my parents,[.5] they avoid it.[A]

[MidLeft]
That doesn't seem right at all.[.6][N]
They've never told you?[A]

[FarRight]
It doesn't feel right either.[.6] What's the[N]
worth of hiding where you're from?[A]

[Right]
Do you think you're[N]
from Heichalot?[A]

[FarRight]
I...[.7] It's not something[N]
I can deny for sure.[A]

[MidLeft]
.[.4].[.4].[A]

Watch out,[.5] S[0xE9]tanta.[.6] The earth[N]
is rockier than we're used to.[A]

[MidRight]
I've noticed that.[A][MoveMidRight]
Hey,[.5] Cethern.[.6] Have you ever[N]
been to Heichalot[A]

[MidLeft]
I've gone to Caer Siddi a few[N]
times with my grandfather...[AN]
But never Heichalot.[.6] Not even[N]
up to Uffren.[A]

[MidRight]
I haven't either...[.6] Do you[N]
think Fern ever went?[A]

[MidLeft]
Maybe she did.[.6] Her mother's[N]
in the Crownflight, so...[A]

[MidRight]
[Beat] I don't know how we'll[N]
explain what happened to A[0xED]fe.[A]

[MidLeft]
That'll be tough.[.6][N]
She could be proud of Ferdiad,[.4] but...[AN]
Losing Airmed or Miach would devastate me.[N]
I can't imagine losing a child.[A]

[MidRight]
[Beat] Hey,[.5] the end of the forest is up ahead.[N]
We can finally get out of here.[A][X]

I've actually been there a few[N]

Makes sense.[.6] You're not from[N]
Cluain Bolg,[.5] after all...[A]

I've been in Cluain Bolg.[AN]

[Beat] I can't deny the[N]

The end of this forest should[N]
be in sight soon enough.[A][X]

This forest sure is rocky...[AN]
I'll have to be careful riding my[N]
horse through it.[A]
I wonder what Heichalot is like...[A][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidLeft]
If grandfather is from Uffren,[.5] maybe[N]
the people there know of him![AN]

Lord Rionall![.6] What is there[N]
to gain from betrayal?![A]

[MidLeft]
Heichalot overpowers us on a[N]
level that is unfathomable.[AN]
To fight back against them is[N]
to doom all of Corbenic.[AN]
Ochren's people are mine to lead,[.4][N]
and I will see them spared![A]

[Right]
So you would surrender[N]
to them?![A]

You do not understand the cataclysm[N]

I'm doing fine...[.6][N]
Don't worry about me.[AN]

I'm not trying to baby you.[AN]
Your swordwork might be inexperienced,[.4][N]

a kid.[.6][ToggleSmile] Glad someone sees my worth![AN][ToggleSmile]
Of course,[.5] if I knew how to ride a horse,[N]
I'd be a lot better...[.6][ToggleSmile] Or a pegasus![AN]
I could be a sky knight like my ma'![A]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Your mother was a Crownflier?[AN]
I didn't know Sir MacCumail had[N]

And once this is all over,[.5] maybe I[N]
