Run along, knave.
I do not wish to fight children.[ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight][LoadMiach]
Well, I wish to fight you!
How dare you invade us!
What have we done to you?![ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x33][0x1]
I'm afraid I don't entirely know myself.
But I have a duty to the prince of Heichalot.
If you truly wish to fight, then I must honour your wishes![X]

So the mercenary returns with a new employer.
Better offer?[ClearFace]

That's how it works.
You understand, don't you?[ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x33][0x1]

Indeed I do.

Caer Ochren is a calm and quiet[N]

the people of Caer Ochren live[N]
unbothered by affairs of either[N]
Corbenic's crown or Heichalot.[AN]
C[0xFA] Raoi of Caer Wydyr uses this[N]
knowledge to plan a surprise[N]
charge on the entire border.[AN]
Unbeknownst to Cethern,[.....] the[N]
peaks have already been crossed[N]
by Heichalotian ideas of treason...[A][X]
