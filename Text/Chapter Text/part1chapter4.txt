Manapia is defended from the[N]
Heichalotian raiders.[AN]
After a few days of repair and[N]
fortification,[.....] Cethern heads[AN]
west back towards the[N]
Pedryvan border encampment.[AN]
There he is entrusted with a[N]
breach through the border[AN]
from the province of Ochren.[A][X]



## P1C4WMIntro2
Ochren is a calm and quiet[N]
land on the eastern part of[N]
Corbenic's dominion.[AN]
Ruled by Lord Rionall, and covered[N]
in untamed forests on one side[N]
and steep peaks on the other,[AN]
the people of Ochren live[N]
unbothered by affairs of either[N]
Corbenic's crown or Heichalot.[AN]
C[0xFA] Raoi of Pedryvan uses this[N]
knowledge to plan a surprise[N]
charge on the entire border.[AN]
Unbeknownst to Cethern,[.....] the[N]
peaks have already been crossed[N]
by Heichalotian ideas of treason...[A][X]

Why don't you join us?[AN]
It's not really a job,[.5][N]

You don't wanna have to[N]
fight me or Ethniu.[A]

I might take you up on that.[A][X]

Ethniu?[.6] Why are you all[N]
the way out here?![A]

[MidRight]
Is it really that[N] 
much of a surprise?[AN]
I'm not chained to[N]
my brother,[.5] Gedeon.[A]

[MidLeft]
I know that,[.5] but I thought you[N]
were helping him back in town![A]

[MidRight]
Found a better job.[.5][N]
Looks like you have too.[A]

[MidLeft]
I wouldn't call it a better job.[AN]
My last one fell through,[.5] and[N]
it's hard enough.[AN]
This is the only thing I could[N]
find that pays.[A]

[MidRight]
It doesn't pay,[.5] but you could[N]
always fight with us.[AN]
I think my brother would[N]
loathe one of us dying.[A]

[MidLeft]
Aengus?[.6] Loathing something?[N]
I couldn't imagine him being[N]
that serious.[AN]
But at the same time,[.5] I don't[N]
think I'd wanna risk it...[A]

[MidRight]
So you're coming with us?[A]

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You know what,[.5] Ethniu?[.6][N]
I think I will.[A][X]

Once I was in Caer Siddi,[.4][N]
walking down the street...[AN]
Next thing I know,[.5] this[N]
girl in a cape runs by me![AN]
I didn't even notice it,[.5] but[N]
she'd stolen all my coin![AN]

it back from them![AN]

I never would've imagined Lord[N]
Rionall to side with Heichalot.[AN]
He's always been the saviour of[N]
Ochren.[.6] Our saviour.[AN]
When Caer Siddi ignored our pleas[N]
for help,[.5] he would answer us.[AN]
Unlike the capital,[.5] he truly[N]
treats us as his own.[AN]
It hurts to see this unfold...[A][X]

Light magic,[.5] holy magic,[.5] or[N]
whatever you call it...[AN]
It is the absolute power of[N]
the Wardbearers.[AN]
To come into contact with their[N]
essence weakens the body.[AN]
The scars it leaves behind hurt[N]
both the body and soul.[AN]
So if you ever see a diviner of[N]
the Wardbearers...[AN]
You'd be best suited dodging[N]
their strikes.[A][X]

These forests sure are dense...
Even more than the ones back home.

[MidLeft]
It's rockier too.
Careful riding through.

[Right]
Have either of you ever been to Heichalot?
Well, probably not you, Cethern.

[MidLeft]
Definitely not.
I've gone to Caer Siddi a few times with my grandfather...
Not much else outside.

[FarRight]
I've actually been to Heichalot a few times.
I was really young though.
Hard to recall anything about it.

[Right]
Oh, right!
Fern, you're not from Cluain Bolg, are you?

[FarRight]
For as long as I can remember, I've been in Cluain Bolg.
But, if I can be honest...
I'm not actually sure where I'm from.

[MidLeft]
You're not sure?
You've told us--

[FarRight]
I know what I've told you.
That was just to get you off my back.
But every time I've brought the question up, my parents avoid it.

[Right]
They avoid it?
That doesn't sound right.

[FarRight]
It doesn't feel right either.
What's worth hiding where you're from?

[MidLeft]
We're almost out of the forest.
Let's keep moving forward.[X]

Hey, Cethern.
Have you ever been to Heichalot?

[MidLeft]
Definitely not.
I've gone to Caer Siddi a few times with my grandfather...
Not much else outside.

[MidRight]
I haven't either...
Do you think Fern ever went?

[MidLeft]
Maybe she did.
Her mother's in the Crownflight, so...

[MidRight]
... ...
I don't know how we'll explain what happened to A[0xED]fe.

[MidLeft]
That'll be tough.
She could be proud of Ferdiad, but...
I couldn't imagine losing Airmed or Miach.

[MidRight]

Hey, the end of the forest is up ahead.
We can finally get out of here.[X]

to doom all of Corbenic.[AN]
Ochren's people are mine to lead,[.4][N]
