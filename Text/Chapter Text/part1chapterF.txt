Cethern, accompanied by his brother,[N]
attacks into Caer Ochren's land.[AN]
Being surrounded by Lord Rionall,[N]
they flee north into Heichalot.[AN]
Chased by sky knights behind them,[N]
Cethern's group moves quickly to[AN]
find refuge along the treacherous[N]
mountain path into Caer Vedwyd.[A][X]

Caer Vedwyd, after its rebellion fourty[N]
years ago, seceeded and joined under[N]
the Principality of Heichalot.[AN]
Cethern enters through the western part[N]
of its border with Corbenic, both[N]
following C[0xFA] Raoi's strategy[AN]
and attempting to flee from the[N]
forces of Caer Ochren on his behind.[AN]
The sky knights pass over him, not[N]
missing his prescence but signalling[N]
forward an unexpected maneuver...[A][X]

Ishpan has been killed by Corbenic.
We forced a small group of their soldiers up the trail.
Stems of Heichalot, Lord Rionall implores that he may leave the rest to you.

[ClearFace][......][FarRight]
Jhudiel, isn't this an interesting situation?
Fleeing into enemy territory...
They must have truly been cornered.

[Right]
They already are cornered.
The trail is narrow and their options are few.

[MidLeft][LoadGedaliah]
Yes, Shield Jhudiel?
Is it finally time?

[Right]
I want you to head out with haste.

Head out with haste and surround the Corbenic forces.

I don't believe now is the time for philosophy, Jhudiel.

[MidLeft]
But Camniel!
As stems of Heichalot, we serve the essence of Heichalot itself.
Yet this war...
I fail to see how it benefits us.

[MidRight]
I refuse to consider that.
The essence of Heichalot is our heavenly prince.
If he wishes to wage war, I shall be on the frontlines.

[MidLeft]
And what happens if Heichalot wages war with Srughna?
Or even Macha?
Heichalot should not ever be all of Maghmeall!

[MidRight]
Bring those arguments up with the clergy.
We need to ready ourselves for battle.
Corbenic cannot be allowed to reach this camp!

[MidLeft]
... ...
Of course.
I apologize for losing focus, Camniel.

That is indeed a staff.
But I don't know how good it'd be for healing.

While I was in Caer Ochren, I received it as a gift from an acolyte of Aingha.

You're from Heichalot, aren't you?
Why are you fighting with us?

[MidRight]
I've got more reason to fight with you than against you.
It's not like my old job gave me much anyways.

[MidLeft]
That's a fair answer...
If you are from Heichalot, though...
I'd like to ask what's going on.

[MidRight]
What's going on?
There's a war going on.
Not much else to say about it.

[MidLeft]
Not like that.
You're from Heichalot, so I wanna ask why--

[MidRight]
Why we'd declare war on you?
Ask the Prince.

[MidLeft]
The Prince of Heichalot?
I've heard him mentioned, and yet...
I don't know anything about him.

[MidRight]
He's the leader of Heichalot.
We venerate Heichalot's Wardbearer through him.

[MidLeft]
Do you know why he'd declare war?

[MidRight]
I'm just a mercenary.
You'd be better asking a clergymember, but...[MoveMidRight]
I've hung around with enough priests to know it's related to their religion.

[MidLeft]
Relating to the bearers?

[MidRight]
Yep.
Maybe a vision told them of the right call to make.

[MidLeft]
A vision?[MoveMidLeft]
But the Wardbearers are dead!
I'm not that religious, but even I know that!

[MidRight]
Maybe it's different in Corbenic, but the Wardbearers have only disappeared.
You're making the assumption that they're dead.

[MidLeft]

Hanlin, can I talk to you about something?

[MidLeft]
Idle chatter may not be the best idea right now.

[MidRight]
I promise it's not idle.
I wanted to ask about Heichalot.
They've declared war on us, yet I can't entirely say I know that much about them.
I don't know why they'd want to invade us.

[MidLeft]
I don't know why either, but it's probably the Prince's doing.
Either him or Heichalot's clergy.

[MidRight]
The Prince of Heichalot...
I've heard him mentioned, and still he's a mystery to me.

[MidLeft]
Heichalot treats him as the highest order of their religion.
They worship the Wardbearer through him.
Perhaps this war is related to that?

[MidRight]
Perhaps it is.
But aren't you from Macha?
How do you know so much about Heichalot?

[MidLeft]
I'm a member of Macha's clergy.
It's easier to hear things when we all venerate the Wardbearers.

[MidRight]
I see...
I'm not the most pious, but I do still acknowledge them.

[MidLeft]
You would do better to give them more respect.
They may be gone, but their presence can still be felt around us.

[MidRight]
Presence...
Around us...[......][MoveMidRight]

That would be correct.
What about it?

[MidRight]
Have you ever been to Heichalot?
I don't know much about them, so I don't know why they'd declare war...
But it still doesn't seem right.
Corbenic hasn't done much, has it?

[MidLeft]
There's nothing I know of that'd be just grounds.
If I had to guess, you should put the blame on either the Prince or his clergy.

[MidRight]
Heichalot's prince...
I've heard him mentioned, yet I know nothing about him.

[MidLeft]
The clergy adore him.
He's mostly kept away from the rest of Maghmeall, though.

[MidRight]
Kept away?

[MidLeft]
He's the centre of their entire religion.
It'd make sense to keep him safe from anything.

This is insane!
You're taking him on by yourself!

[Right]
This is the only option, S[0xE9]tanta!
It's just between the two of us![X]

Cethern!

[FarRight][LoadSadhbh]
Stay away, Miach!
I can't let you both get hurt!

[Right][LoadMiach]
Cethern![MoveRight]
Let go of me, Sadhbh![X]

[MidLeft][LoadJhudiel]
You understand exactly what you're doing, right Cethern?
Who you're facing, and the consequences of it?

[MidRight]
I understand exactly what I'm doing.
This is for my friends, my family...
I can't let them get hurt!

[MidLeft]
Then we'll both be trying our hardest.[MoveMidLeft]
Hit me if you can![X]

[MidLeft][LoadJhudiel]
You're competent, I'll give you that.
But you're facing a stem of Heichalot.
As much as I feel empathy towards your group...
I cannot neglect my duty.

[MidRight]
I know that, Jhudiel.
That's exactly what I'm counting on![X]

[MidLeft][LoadJhudiel]
The opposition has been dealt with.
The rest can be taken back to camp.

[FarFarLeft]
Jhudiel, what is this?[X]

[MidRight][LoadJhudiel]
Camniel, you missed me striking down Corbenic's opposition here.
I was about to take these soldiers' surrender.

[MidLeft]
What are you talking about, Jhudiel?
We were not supposed to add burden to ourselves.
Prisoners are exactly what we were told not to take.

[MidRight]
They cannot fight back against us, Camniel!
Their leader is dead, their morale weakened...
Do you ask of me to kill them?

[MidLeft]
Of course I do not.
That would be what the prince asked of us.
Do you not remember his words?

[MidRight]
His words were not given to me by him.
It was by his clergy.

[MidLeft]
And you distrust the clergy of Heichalot?
Are you a traitor, Jhudiel?

[MidRight]
I...
I am not a traitor.
I am Jhudiel, Shield Stem of Heichalot.

[MidLeft]
Then do what you were told to do.[X]

Look what you've done, Jhudiel.
I'll be bringing this up with the prince![MoveMidLeft]
Everybody, round them up!
Dead or alive![X]



## P1CFJhudielRemorse
[ConversationText]
[MidRight][LoadJhudiel]
None of this is right...
This war isn't right.
This slaughter isn't right.
It'd be foolish to bring this up with the prince...[CloseEyes]
My prince...
I'm sorry to doubt you so.[X]

Have you seen any of the Stems?
They're so cool!
Riding around, with their armour and weapons, taking out evil for the prince...
I've heard that they've gotten a new Stem!
She apparently rides a pegasus!
I want to ride a pegasus like that when I'm older![X]

There's been a fair commotion in the clergy over Corbenic.
And apparently the prince has been hiding from the public.
I'm not sure what's going on, but it doesn't bode well for us.
If he won't show his face, whose to say he's even still well?[X]

Hello.
We don't often get visitors here.
Not many people have the bravery to trek through here.
Especially during the winter!
You're a courageous soul, you know that?[X]
