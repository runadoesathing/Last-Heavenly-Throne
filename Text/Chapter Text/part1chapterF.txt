attacks into Caer Ochren's land.[AN]
Being surrounded by Lord Rionall,[N]
they flee north into Heichalot.[AN]
Chased by sky knights behind them,[N]
Cethern's group moves quickly to[AN]

the Principality of Heichalot.[AN]
Cethern enters through the western part[N]

following C[0xFA] Raoi's strategy[AN]
and attempting to flee from the[N]
forces of Caer Ochren on his behind.[AN]
The sky knights pass over him, not[N]
missing his prescence but signalling[N]

Ishpan has been killed by Corbenic.
We forced a small group of their soldiers up the trail.
Stems of Heichalot, Lord Rionall implores that he may leave the rest to you.

[ClearFace][......][FarRight]
Jhudiel, isn't this an interesting situation?
Fleeing into enemy territory...
They must have truly been cornered.

[Right]
They already are cornered.
The trail is narrow and their options are few.
Gedaliah?

[MidLeft][LoadGedaliah]
Yes, Shield Jhudiel?
Is it finally time?

[Right]
I want you to head out with haste.
Night has fallen, and we must use this to our advantage.
Head out with haste and surround the Corbenic forces.
Camniel and I will follow behind you.

[MidLeft]
Understood, Shield Jhudiel!
I will round everyone up.

[ClearFace][......][Right][ClearFace][MidLeft][LoadJhudiel]
Camniel...
I've been considering a few things.

[FarRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
I don't believe now is the time for philosophy, Jhudiel.

[MidLeft]
But Camniel!
As Stems of Heichalot, we serve the essence of Heichalot itself.
Yet this war...
I fail to see how it benefits us.

[MidRight]
I refuse to consider that.
The essence of Heichalot is our Heavenly Prince.
If he wishes to wage war, I shall be on the frontlines.

[MidLeft]
And what happens if Heichalot wages war with Srughna?
Or even Macha?
Heichalot should not ever be all of Maghmeall!

[MidRight]
Bring those arguments up with the clergy.
We need to ready ourselves for battle.
Corbenic cannot be allowed to reach this camp!

[MidLeft]
... ...
Of course.
I apologize for losing focus, Camniel.

[MidRight]
Take your sword and steed, and charge forward.
Fight for that essence of Heichalot you care so much about.[ClearFace][......]

[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
I will, Camniel.
I will...[X]

Stay in the fortress if you're too scared, Miach.
I couldn't imagine to see you hurt.

I haven't seen them like this since I was back home.

[FarFarRight][LoadSadhbh][MoveMidRight]
Excuse me.
You must be Hanlin, yes?

[MidLeft]
That would be me.
Do you need something?

[MidRight]
I've heard that you're an excellent healer.
I was wondering if you had any use for this?

[MidLeft]
That is indeed a staff.
But I don't know how good it'd be for healing.
Where did you find it?

[MidRight]
While I was in Caer Ochren, I received it as a gift from an acolyte of Aingha.
She said it may turn out useful, so I wanted to get your opinion.

[MidLeft]
... [ToggleSmile]...
I think this will be incredibly useful.
Thank you very much.[X]

This fortress is pitch dark...
We should hide well against the sky knights here.

[MidRight]
It's black with night, but we should be careful.
Is there anything we could use for a small amount of light?

[MidLeft]
Hmm...[MoveMidLeft]
If you could light it with fire, this might do.

[MidRight]
That could do.
Thank you, Hanlin.[X]

It may be a good play to lay low for now.

It's black with night, but we should be careful.
Is there anything we could use for a small amount of light?

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Try using this, Cethern.
You'll need to light it first, but...

[MidRight]
That could do.
Thank you, Lady Sadhbh.[X]

Is there anything we could use for light?

Maybe this?
It won't give much, but...

[MidRight]
That could do.

[MidLeft][LoadCethern]
Gedeon, right?

[MidRight]
That's me.
What's going on?

[MidLeft]
You're from Heichalot, aren't you?
Why are you fighting with us?

[MidRight]
I've got more reason to fight with you than against you.
It's not like my old job gave me much anyways.

[MidLeft]
That's a fair answer...
If you are from Heichalot, though...
I'd like to ask what's going on.

[MidRight]
What's going on?
There's a war going on.
Not much else to say about it.

[MidLeft]
Not like that.
You're from Heichalot, so I wanna ask why--

[MidRight]
Why we'd declare war on you?
Ask the Prince.

[MidLeft]
The Prince of Heichalot?
I've heard him mentioned, and yet...
I don't know anything about him.

[MidRight]
He's the leader of Heichalot.
We venerate Heichalot's Wardbearer through him.

[MidLeft]
Do you know why he'd declare war?

[MidRight]
I'm just a mercenary.
You'd be better asking a clergymember, but...[MoveMidRight]
I've hung around with enough priests to know it's related to their religion.

[MidLeft]
Relating to the bearers?

[MidRight]
Yep.
Maybe a vision told them of the right call to make.

[MidLeft]
A vision?[MoveMidLeft]
But the Wardbearers are dead!
I'm not that religious, but even I know that!

[MidRight]
Maybe it's different in Corbenic, but the Wardbearers have only disappeared.
You're making the assumption that they're dead.

[MidLeft]
... ...
Hold on.
Do you hear that?

[MidRight]
I...[MoveMidRight]
I think I do hear that.

[MidLeft]
Outside.

[MidRight][LoadCethern]
Hanlin, can I talk to you about something?

[MidLeft]
Idle chatter may not be the best idea right now.

[MidRight]
I promise it's not idle.
I wanted to ask about Heichalot.
They've declared war on us, yet I can't entirely say I know that much about them.
I don't know why they'd want to invade us.

[MidLeft]
I don't know why either, but it's probably the Prince's doing.
Either him or Heichalot's clergy.

[MidRight]
The Prince of Heichalot...
I've heard him mentioned, and still he's a mystery to me.

[MidLeft]
Heichalot treats him as the highest order of their religion.
They worship the Wardbearer through him.
Perhaps this war is related to that?

[MidRight]
Perhaps it is.
But aren't you from Macha?
How do you know so much about Heichalot?

[MidLeft]
I'm a member of Macha's clergy.
It's easier to hear things when we all venerate the Wardbearers.

[MidRight]
I see...
I'm not the most pious, but I do still acknowledge them.

[MidLeft]
You would do better to give them more respect.
They may be gone, but their presence can still be felt around us.

[MidRight]
Presence...
Around us...[......][MoveMidRight]
Hanlin, do you hear that?

[MidLeft]
... ...
I believe I do hear that.
It's coming from outside.

[MidRight]
Come with me!
Now![X]

Lady Sadhbh?
You're a Crownflier, so you travel often, right?

[MidLeft]
That would be correct.
What about it?

[MidRight]
Have you ever been to Heichalot?
I don't know much about them, so I don't know why they'd declare war...
But it still doesn't seem right.
Corbenic hasn't done much, has it?

[MidLeft]
There's nothing I know of that'd be just grounds.
If I had to guess, you should put the blame on either the Prince or his clergy.

[MidRight]
Heichalot's prince...
I've heard him mentioned, yet I know nothing about him.

[MidLeft]
The clergy adore him.
He's mostly kept away from the rest of Maghmeall, though.

[MidRight]
Kept away?

[MidLeft]
He's the centre of their entire religion.
It'd make sense to keep him safe from anything.

[MidRight]
I...[......][MoveMidRight]
Hold on.
Lady Sadhbh, do you hear that?

I do.[MoveMidLeft]

Try to keep your head low, Miach.
We don't want to be spotted by anybody.

Why couldn't we run the other way?

[MidRight]
It was the heat of the moment.
We both weren't thinking.
If we head back, Lord Rionall will get us and probably kill us.
It's best if we keep moving.
