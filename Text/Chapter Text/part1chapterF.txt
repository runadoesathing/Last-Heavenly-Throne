Cethern, accompanied by his brother,[N]
advances into Ochren's land.[AN]
Being surrounded by Rionall's forces,[N]
they flee north into Heichalot.[AN]
Chased by sky knights behind them,[N]
Cethern's group moves quickly to[AN]
find refuge along the treacherous[N]
mountain path into Uffren.[A][X]



## P1CFWMIntro2
Uffren, after its rebellion fourty[N]
years ago, seceeded and joined under[N]
the Principality of Heichalot.[AN]
Cethern enters through the western[N]
part of its border with Corbenic,[N]
both following C[0xFA] Raoi's strategy[AN]
and attempting to flee from the[N]
forces of Ochren on his behind.[AN]
The sky knights pass over him, not[N]
missing his prescence but signalling[N]
forward an unexpected maneuver...[A][X]

Heichalot shouldn't have as much[N]

We should be safe for a short time.[.5][N]
Enough to catch our breath.[A]

[MidLeft]
Gedeon,[.5] right?[A]

That's me.[.6] What's going on?[A]

[MidLeft]
You're from Heichalot,[.5] aren't you?[.6][N]
Why did you join up with us?[A]

[MidRight]
I've got more reason to fight[N]
with you than against you.[AN]
It's not like my old job gave[N]
me much anyways.[A]

[MidLeft]
If you are from Heichalot,[.5] though...[.6][N]
I'd like to ask what's going on.[AN]
What's with this war?[A]

[MidRight]
It's a war.[.6] Not much else to[N]
say about it.[AN]
If you wanna know the why,[.4][N]
ask our prince.[A]

[MidLeft]
The prince of Heichalot?[AN]
I've heard him mentioned,[.5] and yet...[.5][N]
I don't know anything about him.[A]

[MidRight]
He's the highest clergyman of Heichalot.[.6][N]
Of course,[.5] it's a blood position,[.5] but...[A]

[MidLeft]
Do you know why he'd declare war?[A]

[MidRight]
I might know a fair bit of the bearers,[.5][N]
but I'm still only a mercenary.[AN]
You'd be better asking a clergymember.[.5][N]
It's gotta be related to them.[A]

[MidLeft]
Is it related to the bearers?[A]

[MidRight]
Perhaps it is.[.6] Maybe a communing with[N]
our bearer told them to do so.[A]

[MidLeft]
Communing?[.6] Is that even possible?[.6] I[N]
thought the bearers were long gone.[A]

[MidRight]
They may be gone,[.5] but their influence[N]
lingers on Maghmeall still.[AN]
They control more than you may think,[.5][N]
even from beyond corporeality.[A]

[MidLeft]
You don't speak like[N]
a mercenary,[.5] Gedeon.[A]

[MidRight]
Like I said,[.5] I've got some[N]
knowledge on the bearers.[AN]
We put much importance on the[N]
study of the Wardbearers.[AN]
Are they not as important to[N]
you as they are to us?[A]

[MidLeft]
Aingha is important to us...[AN]
I can't say I know as much as...[.6][MoveMidLeft][N]

have some relief.[A]

[MidRight]
Thank you for your insight,[.5] Hanlin.[.6][MoveMidRight][N]
Can I talk to you about something?[A]

[MidLeft]
Idle chatter may not be[N]
the best idea right now.[A]

[MidRight]
I promise it's not idle.[.6][N]
I wanted to ask about Heichalot.[AN]
They've declared war on us,[.5] yet[N]
I don't know much about them.[AN]
Why would they invade us?[A]

[MidLeft]
I don't know why either.[.6][N]
It's probably the Prince's doing.[AN]
Either him or Heichalot's clergy.[A]

[MidRight]
The prince of Heichalot...[AN]
I've heard him mentioned,[.5] and[N]
still he's a mystery to me.[A]

[MidLeft]
Heichalot worships their patron[N]
Wardbearer through his existence.[AN]
They claim descendancy from him.[AN]
Of course,[.5] he's also surrounded by[N]
clergy that declare his decrees.[AN]
The war could be their doing as[N]
much as the Heavenly Prince's.[A]

[MidRight]
Aren't you from Macha?[.6] How do you[N]
know so much about Heichalot?[A]

[MidLeft]
That...[.6] is a secret I cannot divulge.[.6][N]
At least at this time.[.6] I'm sorry.[AN]
I can assure you that I am on your side.[.5][N]
We share the same enemy.[AN]
For as long as I believe Heichalot's bearer[N]
is responsible,[.5] I am your ally.[A]

[MidRight]
You...[.5] think this is a Wardbearer's doing?[.6][N]
How would that even work?[A]

[MidLeft]
The Wardbearers are not regular humans[N]
like you or I,[.5] Cethern.[A]
They may be gone,[.5] but their presence[N]
can still be felt around us.[A]

[MidRight]
Presence...[.5] Around us...?[......][MoveMidRight][N]

Have you ever been to Heichalot?[AN]
I don't know much about them,[.5] so[N]
why they'd declare war...[AN]
I can't think of a reason why.[.5][N]
Has Corbenic done anything?[A]

[MidLeft]
There's nothing I know of to be just.[AN]
If I had to guess,[.5] you should put the[N]
blame on the prince or his clergy.[A]

[MidRight]
Heichalot's prince...[AN]
I've heard him mentioned,[.5] yet[N]
I know nothing about him.[A]

[MidLeft]
The clergy adore him. If you think the[N]
priests of Aingha are devout...[AN]
You've not seen how Heichalot treats[N]
their patron Wardbearer.[A]

[MidRight]
I've not met much of either.[.6][N]
Are they that devoted?[A]

[MidLeft]
Their bearer is the centre of[N]
Heichalot's entire culture.[AN]
The Heavenly Prince is just a[N]
proxy for their Wardbearer.[A]

[MidRight]
That doesn't sound...[.6] Hold on.[.6][N]
