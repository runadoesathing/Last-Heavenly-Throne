Ever since my banishment...
I've sought revenge.
The Anusuya Grove will burn to the ground![X]

[MidRight][LoadSoma]
Chakora?
What are you doing with the enemy?![ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadChakora]
Soma...
So you came back.
It's too late to convince me.[ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSoma]
What happened to you?!
Why are you fighting against your own people?![ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadChakora]
My people?!
The Anusuya Grove, who left me to rot?!
Even though I did nothing wrong![ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSoma]
I don't know what happened.
But we've both changed.
It's unfortunate we have to fight...[X]

[MidLeft][LoadChakora]
The white-haired oracle of Hwen...
I never expected to see your face on this battlefield.[ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
Why do the orders fight?
What have we done?[ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadChakora]
What have you done?!
My people exiled me, all for the crime of nothing!
I left to enlighten myself, only to return and lose everything to this horrid monastery![ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadSrihwen]
But why do you come back to conquer them...?
Will unity with Antariksa and Anila bring you joy?[ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadChakora]
Quiet!
You come here with a sheltered mind.
Your death would be an ultimate revenge on Chandra![X]
