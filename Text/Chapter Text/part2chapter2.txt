Excuse her.
She may be a rare bird, but she is reliable.

[FarRight]
Rare bird?
That's a compliment, right?

[Right]
Anyhow, your group is from the Order of Dhara, yes?
We were told by the Order of Chandra that you were in danger.
Besides that, we haven't been told much else of the situation.

[MidLeft]
There's been attacks on our orders from further east.
It's happened before, but never at this intensity...
Apparently they wish to conquer us.

[Right]
Conquer you?
That's not good at all, both for you or Srughna...
If we may, priestess of Dhara...

[MidLeft]
Oh, my name...
My name is Srihwen.

[Right]
Srihwen, if you would allow us, we would like to join your fight.

[FarRight]
We're joining them?[ToggleSmile]
I guess it's better than hanging around here.

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Thank you both, knights of Srughna.
We're heading out to Dhara before sundown.

These walls...

Are these of the Springmother?
And that must be the Penumbra...

I am Nandi of House Abhira.
The other two that were with me are Sanjana and Varuna.
They're both soldiers of House Vraja.

These houses are Srughnan, correct?
I can't say I know much of them.
