Wham![MoveMidRight] Bam![MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Have you ever seen an axe as good as this?
Look how pristine its curvature is!
How it flows as you swing it down!
Ha![MoveMidRight][LoadOverworldFaces][ToggleSmile]
Oh my...
That's quite...[......] a large dent.
Maybe you should take this off my hands.
Don't need to get yelled at![X]

I thought bows were supposed to be huge.
Make your arms hurt, need a lot of strength.
Then my dad got me this from the capital.
It's like a toy!
But it's not.
You could shoot someone's eye out still.
Well, I'm not a kid.
I'd rather use a bigger bow.
You have a younger someone to give it to?[X]

Hey!
Look at this bottle!
I thought it'd taste good, but it tastes really weird...
I don't know why you'd wanna drink it!
But hey, maybe you could splash someone with it![X]

Have you ever locked your children in their rooms with magic?
I haven't.
That's sadistic.
But I've thought about it.
This thing right here, it's really good at blocking doorways.
I've considered using it, but I'm hard-pressed to find a good use for it.
Do you want it?
Just promise you won't lock your kids in.[X]

Conflict here so soon...
I pray Aingha keeps us safe.[MoveMidLeft]
Who is Aingha?
Well, she's the Wardbearer of Corbenic!
Our lush soil, our rich game, our livelihood...
It all depends on her.
She nurtures us, she protects us...
You could consider her the greatest of all grandmothers.
I only hope her protection is enough against Heichalot.[X]

Miach! You're gonna spill the water everywhere! 
It took so long to heat!

[OpenMidLeft]
You try holding it! It's hotter and heavier than you think!

[OpenMidRight]
I can't believe the nurse let you do this with me!

[OpenMidLeft]
I can't believe the nurse thought you were the best person to take care of him! 
If you're gonna nag at me, do the whole thing yourself!

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadCethern]
Miach? Airmed?
Are you both in there?

[OpenMidLeft]
It's Cethern![MoveMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]

[OpenMidRight]
Why are you putting the pot down?! 
Our grandpa needs it!

[MoveLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadAirmed]
[OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Am I bothering something?
I see you're both quite busy.

[OpenFarLeft]
Cethern! Did you beat those bandits into a pulp?!

[OpenFarRight]
I guess you could say that.
You both taking care of our old man?

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'm trying to take care of him.
But Miach keeps messing everything up!

[OpenFarLeft]
Sorry, who did the nurse say could help?
You're not even helping, only bossing me around![MoveFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Can I come kill some brigands instead with you next time, Cethern?

[OpenFarRight]
I'll think about it. 
I think you've got a lot of training yourself before you could help.

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
That's not fair! 
Am I not allowed?
I've actually been working myself tired unlike some brothers!
I'm barely even younger than you!

[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]
...[ToggleSmile]Maybe I should leave you two alone.
You're better taking care of him without me distracting you.
I'll be out helping with some of the clean-up.

[ClearFace][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft][......]
Airmed!
You scared him away!

[OpenLeft]
What are you talking about?!
It was obviously your begging![X]
