Wham![MoveMidRight] Bam![MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Have you ever seen an axe as good as this?
Look how pristine its curvature is!
How it flows as you swing it down!
Ha![MoveMidRight][LoadOverworldFaces][ToggleSmile]
Oh my...
That's quite...[......] a large dent.
Maybe you should take this off my hands.
Don't need to get yelled at![X]

I thought bows were supposed to be huge.
Make your arms hurt, need a lot of strength.
Then my dad got me this from the capital.
It's like a toy!
But it's not.
You could shoot someone's eye out still.
Well, I'm not a kid.
I'd rather use a bigger bow.
You have a younger someone to give it to?[X]

Hey!
Look at this bottle!
I thought it'd taste good, but it tastes really weird...
I don't know why you'd wanna drink it!
But hey, maybe you could splash someone with it![X]

Have you ever locked your children in their rooms with magic?
I haven't.
That's sadistic.
But I've thought about it.
This thing right here, it's really good at blocking doorways.
I've considered using it, but I'm hard-pressed to find a good use for it.
Do you want it?
Just promise you won't lock your kids in.[X]

Conflict here so soon...
I pray Aingha keeps us safe.[MoveMidLeft]
Who is Aingha?
Well, she's the Wardbearer of Corbenic!
Our lush soil, our rich game, our livelihood...
It all depends on her.
She nurtures us, she protects us...
You could consider her the greatest of all grandmothers.
I only hope her protection is enough against Heichalot.[X]
