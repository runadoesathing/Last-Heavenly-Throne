Picodobra...
It feels similar to Cluain Bolg.
Doesn't feel like we're far from home.

[OpenMidLeft]
It's a smaller village.
We're so close to the border, yet everyone is so calm.

[OpenRight]
Most of the fighting has been kept east of here.
These people are spared strife.

[OpenFarRight]
Are you from Caer Wydyr, Hanlin?
Your dress and hair are interesting.

[OpenRight]
I am not. I come from the far north of Macha.

[OpenMidLeft]
Macha? How did you get involved with this conflict?
From what I've heard, Macha and Heichalot are allies, not enemies...

[OpenRight]
I am somewhat distrusted because of it.
But my duty is to heal, not to fight.
Most who do not like me change their mind when I tend to their wounds.

Not all of us are as loyal to Heichalot.
Of course, with me being Macha, I am somewhat distrusted by others.

What business do you have here?

[OpenLeft]
We've been sent here from Caer Wydyr to help fortify Picodobra against Heichalot.

[OpenMidRight]
Shows what a sad time it is...
But we don't need any protection.
We've already got our own guard watching the town as we speak.

[OpenLeft]
Your own guard?
Where are they?

[OpenMidRight]
They're holed up and rarin' to go in the watchtower on the outskirts of town.
Don't worry.
When the sun comes tomorrow youse can ride back out east.

[OpenLeft]
Are you sure you need no bolstering?
Your village is close to Heichalot.

[OpenMidRight]
We've always been friendly with those on the other side.
Even with the war, who's to say that stops now?[MoveMidRight]
Come now, rest yourselves up and leave back tomorrow.
You must be exhausted.[ClearFace][......]

[OpenFarLeft]
This isn't right.
Those close to the border could be friendly, but they still have ties.
Heichalotians feel quite heavy loyalties to their nation.

Let's keep our guards up.
Rest may be good for us right now, but Heichalot could strike at any time.[X]

Nothin' to worry about.

Better to keep youse safe to head back in one piece.

We came here to help protect Picodobra, not sit around like helpless children!
I'm sorry sir, but I'll need to head past you.

I will not!
This is Picodobra's business.

You must both be the guard of the town.
I thank you for your assistance earlier.

It's what we're supposed to do.
We don't do much often though, so some of us stick to napping during their watch.
Isn't that right, Aengus?

[Left]
Pretend you haven't slacked off during your watch!

[FarLeft]
I'm not the one stationed here.
I only do this because you're my brother!
If I didn't cover for you, this town would be ash.[.....]
Maybe I should leave to help against Heichalot and see how you do alone.

[MidRight]
I wouldn't be against more help, but it seems like Picodobra could use all the protection it can get.

[Left]
Ethniu, you can't leave me alone!
If you're gonna leave, I'm comin' with ya!

[FarLeft]
You shouldn't worry about Picodobra.
By the time it can be protected, we can have way more than two people watching over everyone.
Give us the few days and we'll be well ready for anything else.

The path into Caer Ochren is small and rarely used.
