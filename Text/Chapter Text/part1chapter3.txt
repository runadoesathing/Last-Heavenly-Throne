The party departs towards[N]
the encampment on the border[N]
between Corbenic and Heichalot.[AN]
Bringing with them Cethern's[N]
younger brother, Miach,[.5] they rout[AN]
an abandoned fortress of bandits[N]
harrassing a young magician.[AN]
With an additional notch on their[N]

Golud to the Pedryvan camp.[A][X]



## P1C3WMIntro2
Pedryvan covers the majority[N]
of Corbenic's border with the[N]
Principality of Heichalot.[AN]
Originally a neighbour to Uffren[N]
before its rebellion,[.....] Pedryvan[AN]
normally shares friendship[N]

Lady Sadhbh.
It is interesting to see you at this hour.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Lord Rionall.
I apologize for the late entry.
During times of war, speed is of the essence.

[MidLeft]
Indeed it is, indeed it is...
What is required of me now?

[MidRight]
It is business from the Pedryvan border camp.
Questions from the tacticians about the amount of support you have given.

[MidLeft]
Lady Sadhbh, I have given as much support as I can.
Our already small militia is protecting this side of the border from Heichalotian assault.
We have given what food we can to your encampment.
What else does Pedryvan ask of us?

[MidRight]
The path into Ochren is small and rarely used.
Are you certain that no more of your forces can be given?

[MidLeft]
I am absolutely certain, Lady Sadhbh.
Perhaps you may find resolution when the soldiers in Srughna return.

[MidRight]
Mayhaps we will.
The encampment shall be informed of your current perils.
Please continue with your aid, Lord of Ochren.[ClearFace][.......]

[FarFarRight]
Has she left back for Pedryvan?

[MidLeft]
Indeed she has.
I am terribly sorry to hide you away.

[MidRight][LoadIshpan][LoadOverworldFaces]
No matter.
The gravity of the manner calls for it.
I assume Heichalot may still count on your assistance?

[MidLeft]
So long as my people are kept unharmed, my lands are yours.
I understand that any struggle would be futile.

[MidRight]
Ochren will be left alone.
Your land will join Uffren in its union under the prince.

[MidLeft]
That is fine.
I thank you for your merciful grace in allowing my surrender.

[MidRight]
I shall return to Uffren to tell my men the news.
If any more forces from Corbenic bother you, they will deal with us at your borders.[ClearFace][......]

[MidLeft]
I am making the correct call.
This is the right decision for my people...[X]
