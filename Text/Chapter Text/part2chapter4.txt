Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes...
It'd make sense that you're here.

[MidRight]
You...!
You're from Corbenic!
Ethniu, that other magician, right?

[MidLeft]
It's been a long time, hasn't it?
We didn't get to talk much, but...

[MidRight]
I don't think there's much time to talk now either!
You're not with the Antariksan Order, are you?

[MidLeft]
Dhara.
We're on your side, don't worry.

[MidRight]
Oh, thank our Penumbra...!
We should get moving then![ToggleSmile]
Let's blast them back to their own monastery!

[ToggleSmile][MidLeft][MidRight][ClearFace][......][MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It seems time didn't wipe away her enthusiasm, that girl...[X]

Rudram!
You found help!

[MidLeft]
Indeed I did!
They're from the Dharan Order.
Apparently Antariksa's been giving them trouble too.

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
So they'll wanna help us!
Perfect!

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
We should fall in with them.
Best to stay with the group so you don't get hurt.

[MidRight]
I don't need to worry about getting hurt![ToggleSmile]
I might not be bulky, but I'll sure incinerate them into dust!

[ToggleSmile][MidLeft][MidRight][ClearFace][......][MidLeft]
She needs to be more careful, that Talitha.
Both our orders would be devastated if either of us got hurt.
Well, then again, [CloseEyes]my order probably thinks I'm dead...[X]

Please, hold your fire...!
We're here to help you.

[MidRight]
You...!
You're that daughter of Hwen, aren't you?!

[MidLeft]
I...
I guess you could put it that way.

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Thank goodness!
The Penumbra watches over us once again!
You know, your face looks real familiar...

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I[....]-I don't think we've met before...

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Eh, it's probably the pure heart of Hwen shining through.
Come on, we need to get moving!
Let's blast them back to their own monastery!

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][MidRight][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][......][MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
She knows I only have a healing staff, right...?[X]
